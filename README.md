# Problem Statement
There is a lot of physical problem faced by people during this pandemic, so there is a need of solution where people don’t have to go any where and they can get instant solution for the problem like disease from which they are suffering.
We Team Deep thinkers have developed platform for people by using which they can know from which disease they are suffering and what is the cure of it.

# Technology Used
1.	Natural Language Processing
2.	Angular - FrontEnd
3.	Deep Learning
4.	FastAPI – used for creating api
5.	Bert – opensource data encoder powered by google

# Description
# How our solution is working on primary care?

Our solution allows user to share the symptom that they are feeling and based on symptom our prepared model predicts and gives instant solution for it. So, from here we can see that it is proving the primary care to the user in a second.
